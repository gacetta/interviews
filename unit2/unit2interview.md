high level language - 
timeline of computers:
binary->assemble->c->javascript
append() vs appendChild();
emmet: ! + TAB
return value: undefined (also called void) in other language

To Ask:

1. Open a blank page in the browser and access the dev tools
- can you create an h1 element with text using JS?
- can you add text to that element (text content)
- can you replace all the text in that element to say "My Favorite Foods"
- now can you create an ordered list and add your favorite food food to it
- can you add two more foods? (createElement -> appendChild x 2 or, append(food1, food2))
- can you remove the first food (querySelector will select first element)

2. Now open up VSCode
- we're going to do the same thing in vsCode.  Create an html file with boilerplate info, add a title.
- Create JS file.  Add an h1. 
- Render this in a browser.
